# Quantum CGNN
An extension of the CGNN discovery algorithm to quantum scenarios.

Standard causal modeling techniques cannot provide a causal explanation for certain types of quantum correlations. In particular, the statistical pattern of dependencies and independencies in the EPR-Bell scenario is so weird that any discovery algorithm that assumes the  causal Markov condition (CMC) and the causal faithfulness (CFC) assumptions cannot provide a causal graph for the scenario. This puzzle is referred to as the causal problem of entanglement.

The present repository offers an alternative way of tackling the causal problem of entanglment, which is empirical in spirit. I exploit recent advances in Machine Learning to build a framework to adjudicate between various proposals for the causal problem empirically. To this end, I take a classical causal discovery algorithm called [Causal Generative Neural Network (CGNN)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.08936v2.pdf) and adapt it to the causal problem in light of philosophical and foundational considerations. The key idea is to compare the predictive power of different candidate models and find the candidate that can generate data whose distribution is *closer* to the original quantum data. The essential point is that the present framework can empirically compare a wide range of proposed models for the causal problem without getting involved in the CMC-CFC dilemma.
